# üìà IDX Stock Analysis

Comprehensive stock analysis project for IDX (Indonesia Stock Exchange) using Python.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world **Data Science workflow**: from data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, to forecasting.  
This project is intended as a portfolio piece for Data Science and Analytics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Data collection using `yfinance` for selected IDX tickers
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with summary statistics
- Visualizations (candlestick, moving averages, returns distribution, correlation heatmaps)
- Time series analysis & forecasting (ARIMA/Linear Regression/LSTM as extensions)
- Insights & recommendations for investors

## üìä Roadmap
1. **Data Collection**
   - Get stock data from IDX tickers (e.g., TLKM, BBCA, ASII)
